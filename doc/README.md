Yody Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Yody Core is the original Yody client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Yody transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Yody Core, visit [yodycore.org](https://www.yodycore.org/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Yody Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/yody-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/yodyd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run yody-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Yody Core to your applications folder, and then run Yody Core.
